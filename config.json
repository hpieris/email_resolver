  "description": "A multi-agent system that schedules meetings based on availability and preferences.",
  "overview": "The 'email_resolver' blueprint is designed to automate meeting scheduling by combining calendar access, AI scheduling, and notifications. It begins with the `calendar_fetcher`, which retrieves the user's availability. Then, the `scheduler` selects optimal meeting times. Finally, the `notifier` sends out meeting confirmations or alerts. This setup reduces manual scheduling effort and ensures efficient time management.",
